## Hi there üëã

I major in **Applied Statistics** and **Computer Science**, and I am an interested student in **Data Science** and **ML/DL**.
<br>
I've been studying various fields, but now I'm going to try to deepen my studies with **Data Science** places.   
<br>
I have a strength in **Modeling** rather than analyzing data(It's not that I can't analyze better than others because I majored in statistics.),   
and I'm currently studying in the **"CAU-ET"** AI lab.
